In this work, a scoring method entitled MELO capable of measuring and locating the structural variation of protein was thus developed. This method was unique in a) enabling comprehensive measurement by collectively considering the changes in Geometric characteristics and Relative distances among amino acids, and b) realizing high-throughput location of structure alterations by simultaneously assessing the variations of secondary structures and the shifts among protein segments. Compared with available methods, MELO was found best-performing in identifying the structure change of various degrees of magnitude (some increases were >30%) and capable of precisely measuring such structure change and locating altered region in critical case studies. Based on the MELOâ€™s performance as mentioned above, additional work on scanning PDB was conducted, which identified >10,000 structure changes induced by subtle variation that existing methods failed to detect. Finally, an online server (https://MELO.prostco.net/) was constructed to not only allow the users to upload their own structures for enabling customized comparisons, but also provide all those identified (>10,000) protein pairs of structure change as an accessible database (which had been reported to be urgently demanded by the research communities3). All in all, MELO performed well in measuring and locating protein structural variations, and would become an essential complement to the available methods in research community.
